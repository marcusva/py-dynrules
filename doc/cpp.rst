C++ Implementation
==================
The C++ implementation of dynrules features a set of classes similar to
the Python implementation and can be found in the ``cplusplus/``
subdirectory of the distribution.

Installation
------------
The C++ implementation ships with an own set of build instructions that
are completely independent from Python. To build (and install) it, you
can use the ``make`` tool on Unix-like platforms ::

  $ make && make install

and the Visual Studio.NET solution file under ``win32/`` on Windows
platforms.

Usage
-----
For conrete details about the API, please take a look at either the
header file comments or the API documentation in ``cplusplus/doc/html``.
